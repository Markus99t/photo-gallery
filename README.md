## To run project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install dependencies
Use the `npm install` command, or its short equivalent `npm i`, to install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 2. Start the development server:

To start the development server with application, use the `npm start` command.

This will launch the project, and the application should open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. If you're already using port 3000 for other projects, the port may be different.
